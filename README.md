# cwtwb

> **Tableau Workbook (.twb) generation toolkit for reproducible dashboards and workbook engineering**
> Programmatically create Tableau workbooks with stable analytical primitives, dashboard composition, and built-in structural validation.

## Overview

**cwtwb** is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server and Python toolkit for generating Tableau Desktop workbook files (`.twb`) from code or AI-driven tool calls.

It is designed as a **workbook engineering layer**, not as a conversational data exploration agent. The goal is to make workbook generation reproducible, inspectable, and safe to automate in local workflows, scripts, and CI.

The default workflow is:

1. Start from a known template or the built-in zero-config template
2. Add calculated fields and parameters
3. Build worksheets from stable chart primitives
4. Assemble dashboards and interactions
5. Save and validate a `.twb` that opens in Tableau Desktop

## Installation

```bash
pip install cwtwb
```

To run the bundled Hyper-backed example that inspects `.hyper` files and
resolves the physical `Orders_*` table automatically, install the optional
example dependency as well:

```bash
pip install "cwtwb[examples]"
```

### Requirements

- Python >= 3.10
- [lxml](https://lxml.de/) >= 5.0
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
- [mcp](https://pypi.org/project/mcp/) >= 1.0

## Quick Start

### As MCP Server

To allow an MCP client to build Tableau workbooks automatically, add `cwtwb`
to that client's MCP configuration.

The launch command is the same across clients:

```bash
uvx cwtwb
```

Each client stores this command in a different configuration format. Use the
matching example below.

#### Claude Desktop

Open `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on macOS or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` on Windows and add:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cwtwb": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["cwtwb"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Cursor IDE

1. Open **Cursor Settings** -> **Features** -> **MCP**
2. Click **Add New MCP Server**
3. Set **Type** to `command`
4. Set **Name** to `cwtwb`
5. Set **Command** to `uvx cwtwb`

#### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add cwtwb -- uvx cwtwb
```

#### VSCode

Open the workspace `.vscode/mcp.json` file or your user-profile `mcp.json`
file and add:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "cwtwb": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["cwtwb"]
    }
  }
}
```

In VSCode, you can open these files from the Command Palette with
**MCP: Open Workspace Folder Configuration** or
**MCP: Open User Configuration**. You can also use **MCP: Add Server** and
enter the same `uvx cwtwb` command through the guided flow.

### As Python Library

Use `TWBEditor(...)` to start from a template and rebuild workbook content.
Use `TWBEditor.open_existing(...)` when you want to keep existing worksheets
and dashboards and reconfigure a sheet in place.

```python
from cwtwb.twb_editor import TWBEditor

editor = TWBEditor("templates/twb/superstore.twb")
editor.clear_worksheets()
editor.add_calculated_field("Profit Ratio", "SUM([Profit])/SUM([Sales])")

editor.add_worksheet("Sales by Category")
editor.configure_chart(
    worksheet_name="Sales by Category",
    mark_type="Bar",
    rows=["Category"],
    columns=["SUM(Sales)"],
)

editor.add_worksheet("Segment Pie")
editor.configure_chart(
    worksheet_name="Segment Pie",
    mark_type="Pie",
    color="Segment",
    wedge_size="SUM(Sales)",
)

editor.add_dashboard(
    dashboard_name="Overview",
    worksheet_names=["Sales by Category", "Segment Pie"],
    layout="horizontal",
)

editor.save("output/my_workbook.twb")
```

## Capability Model

### Core primitives

These are the stable building blocks the project should continue to promise:

- **Bar**
- **Line**
- **Area**
- **Pie**
- **Map**
- **Text** / KPI cards
- Parameters and calculated fields
- Basic dashboard composition

### Advanced patterns

These are supported, but they are higher-level compositions or interaction features rather than the default surface area:

- **Scatterplot**
- **Heatmap**
- **Tree Map**
- **Bubble Chart**
- **Dual Axis**
- Filter zones, parameter controls, color legends
- Dashboard filter and highlight actions
- Declarative JSON layout workflows

### Recipes and showcase patterns

These can be generated today, but they should be treated as recipes or examples rather than first-class promises:

- **Donut**
- **Lollipop**
- **Bullet**
- **Bump**
- **Butterfly**
- **Calendar**

Recipe charts are intentionally exposed through a single `configure_chart_recipe`
tool so the public MCP surface does not grow one tool at a time for every
showcase pattern.

This distinction matters because `cwtwb` is not trying to become a chart zoo or compete with Tableau's own conversational analysis tooling. The project is strongest when it provides a reliable, automatable workbook generation layer.

### Capability-first workflow

When you are not sure whether something belongs in the stable SDK surface:

1. Use `list_capabilities` to inspect the declared boundary
2. Use `describe_capability` to check a specific chart, encoding, or feature
3. Use `analyze_twb` or `diff_template_gap` before chasing a showcase template

This keeps new feature work aligned with the project's real product boundary instead of with whatever happens to appear in a sample workbook.

## Built-in Validation

`save()` automatically validates the TWB XML structure before writing:

- **Fatal errors** such as missing `<workbook>` or `<datasources>` raise `TWBValidationError`
- **Warnings** such as missing `<view>` or `<panes>` are logged but do not block saving
- Validation can be disabled with `editor.save("output.twb", validate=False)`

## Dashboard Layouts

| Layout | Description |
|---|---|
| `vertical` | Stack worksheets top to bottom |
| `horizontal` | Place worksheets side by side |
| `grid-2x2` | 2x2 grid layout for up to four worksheets |
| `dict` or `.json` path | Declarative custom layouts for more complex dashboards |

Custom layouts can be built programmatically using a nested `layout` dictionary or via `generate_layout_json` for MCP workflows.

## Hyper-backed Example

The advanced example at `examples/hyper_and_new_charts.py` now prefers the
`Sample - EU Superstore.hyper` extract bundled under the Tableau Advent
Calendar assets and resolves the physical `Orders_*` table via Tableau Hyper
API before switching the workbook connection.
