"""Migration-oriented MCP tools — re-target an existing TWB onto a new datasource.

PURPOSE
-------
These tools allow an AI agent to take an existing Tableau workbook (built
against one datasource/Excel file) and reconnect it to a different datasource
without rebuilding from scratch.  All calculated fields, dashboard layouts,
and chart configurations are preserved; only field name references change.

FIVE-STEP WORKFLOW (must be followed in order)
----------------------------------------------
  Step 1 — inspect_target_schema(target_source)
      Read the column names and data types from the new Excel file.
      Returns a JSON object: {"fields": [...], "sample_values": {...}}.

  Step 2 — profile_twb_for_migration(file_path, target_source, scope)
      Scan the TWB to discover which datasource is used, which worksheets
      are in scope ("workbook" | "worksheet:Name"), and which fields appear.
      Returns a JSON profile summary.

  Step 3 — propose_field_mapping(file_path, target_source, mapping_overrides)
      Fuzzy-match source field names to target field names and return a
      ranked candidate list with confidence scores.
      Use mapping_overrides={source: target} to force specific mappings.

  Step 4 — preview_twb_migration(file_path, target_source, mapping_overrides)
      Dry-run the full migration: report blocking issues (fields that cannot
      be mapped), warnings (low-confidence matches), and the rewrite summary.
      Does NOT write any files.

  Step 5a — apply_twb_migration(file_path, target_source, output_path)
      Write the migrated TWB to output_path plus a JSON report.
      Only call this after reviewing the preview and confirming no blockers.

  Step 5b — migrate_twb_guided(file_path, target_source, output_path)
      Combined convenience wrapper: runs preview, pauses if warnings exist
      for agent confirmation, then applies if apply_if_no_blockers=True.

SCOPE PARAMETER
---------------
  "workbook"          — migrate all worksheets (default)
  "worksheet:Name"    — migrate only the named worksheet
