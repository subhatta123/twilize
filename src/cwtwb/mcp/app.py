"""FastMCP server singleton for the cwtwb MCP server.

This module creates the single FastMCP `server` instance that all tool and
resource modules register against via @server.tool() and @server.resource().

Import order matters: app.py must be imported before tools_*.py and resources.py
so that `server` exists when the decorators run.  The entry point (typically
run via `mcp run` or `python -m cwtwb.mcp`) imports all tool modules, which
self-register, and then starts the server transport.

The `instructions` string is what AI agents read when they first connect —
it summarises the required call order and points agents to skill resources.
