"""Capability catalog and workbook analysis MCP tools.

These tools help an AI agent understand what twilize can and cannot do before
attempting to build or migrate a workbook.

TOOL INVENTORY
--------------
  list_capabilities()
      Return the full capability catalog from capability_registry.py as a
      formatted text table.  Shows every declared chart type, encoding, and
      feature with its support level (core / advanced / recipe / unsupported).
      Call this at the start of a session to know what is possible.

  describe_capability(kind, name)
      Return details for a single capability entry — level, description, and
      any caveats.  Use when the catalog shows something unexpected.

  analyze_twb(file_path)
      Parse an existing .twb file and report:
        - Which chart types and encodings it uses.
        - Which capabilities are core, advanced, recipe-level, or unsupported.
        - The full capability gap section (features used that twilize cannot yet
          reproduce automatically).
      Combines twb_analyzer.to_text() + to_gap_text() in one call.

  diff_template_gap(file_path)
      Return only the capability gap section (a subset of analyze_twb output).
      Useful when you already understand the workbook structure and just need
      to know what the SDK cannot handle.

  validate_workbook(file_path=None)
      Validate a saved .twb/.twbx file — or the current in-memory editor —
      against the official Tableau XSD schema (2026.1).  Failures are
      informational: Tableau Desktop is the true validator.
