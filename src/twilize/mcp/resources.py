"""MCP resources exposed by twilize — read-only reference data for AI agents.

Resources are different from tools: they are read-only data blobs that an
AI agent fetches for context, not actions that modify state.

AVAILABLE RESOURCES
-------------------
  file://docs/tableau_all_functions.json
      Complete list of Tableau calculation functions with syntax and examples.
      Source: docs/tableau_all_functions.json (bundled with twilize).
      Use this to look up function signatures when writing calculated fields.

  twilize://skills/index
      Markdown index listing all available agent skill files with descriptions.
      Read this first to understand which skills exist before fetching one.

  twilize://skills/{skill_name}
      A specific agent skill Markdown file.  Skills are expert-level guides
      for common phases of workbook construction:
        - calculation_builder  → writing Tableau formulas and calculated fields
        - chart_builder        → choosing mark types and encoding best practices
        - dashboard_designer   → layout patterns, zone sizing, action wiring
        - formatting           → color palettes, font choices, style consistency

USAGE PATTERN (recommended by server instructions)
---------------------------------------------------
  Before each major phase, fetch the relevant skill:
    read_resource("twilize://skills/chart_builder")    # before configure_chart
    read_resource("twilize://skills/dashboard_designer") # before add_dashboard
